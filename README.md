Coords package implements elementary action on GPS points such as adding two points, find the azimuth and elevation, find the distance between two points and more. 
 In addition, the package File Format implements some action on CSV file, and object we created such as element, layer and project. We read a CSV file and convert each line into a element, each CSV file is a layer and multiple Csv file is a project.
